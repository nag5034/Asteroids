Title:
Asteroids

Description:
Make a simple playable asteroids game. 

Functionality:
The user uses the arrow keys to move, space to fire one bullet 
per press, and shift to fire lazers at the asteroids as a power
up incase one is about to hit you but be careful and only use it
sparingly because it decrements your score! The score is based on
how often you use the power up, and the amount of asteroids destroyed. 

Issues:
1. If you shoot the bullets very quickly in succesion it sometimes breaks the game.
2. I can not get the lives to decrement properly. 


Notes: 
My Above and beyonds were the laser power up feature and when you destroy all the asteroids it displays "You Won!".
